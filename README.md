## Navigation test

<!-- Short description of what your project does(3-4 senetnces)-->
This project was designed with the purpose of creating navigation bars. I have created navigation bars in college and brought them back to use as a reference in the future. 

## Technologies

<!-- Technologies you used -->
- HTML
- CSS
- **Visual Studio**

## Features

<!-- What the users can do -->
All you gotta do is just hover your mouse over the text of each bar to play with the colors. 

## The Process

<!-- The process of how I build it -->
I just wanted to keep this projcet nice and simple. So I decided to use the nav element with non working links, so that I can reuse that code in the future. I first wrote the css code in the style tags of html. Then I created other navigation bars and gave them names for labeling purposes. From there I messed with each navbars positions using top, left and position in style.css. 

## What I learned

<!-- In 2-3 sentences tell everyone what you learned -->
I learned how to finally link the style.css sheet to the main index.html project. Re-learning this allows me keep my projects nice and orgainzed in the index.html files. I have also leanred GitHub shows the CSS icon as a seprate file once your project is posted, so I will have to keep that in mind in the future.

## How it can be improved?

<!--What I could've done better -->
If I have time I could make a second version of using navigation bars where the bars can extend to the entire page. Doing the navigation bars that way will create a more professional look for a future website. 

## Running the project
